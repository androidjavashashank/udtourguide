1)Remove 2.1 API and lower support when all devices support the higher API?

2)Animate to the current location differently(not in the Activity).

3)Add options(maybe configure hollow drawings).

4)Stream files instead of keeping them locally(it waste too much space).

5)Change collision detection to square or something else.

6)Get real blurbs to be played bad.

7)Implement location control that allows clicking.

8)Make sound louder?
