1) Port to Android 2.2 API. (Change dialog code). There is no way to do conditional compilation, so
I cannot support both platforms.

2)Animate to the current location differently(not in the Activity).

3)Add options(maybe configure hollow drawings).

4)Stream files instead of keeping them locally(it waste too much space).

5)Change collision detection to square or something else.

6)Get real blurbs to be played bad.
